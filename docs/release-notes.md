### What's New

This is the first release of Citrix `istio-adaptor`. `istio-adaptor` is Citrix's solution to configure Citrix ADC as an Ingress Gateway and/or sidecar proxy in Istio Service mesh. It acts as a client to gRPC based services in Istio control plane, listens to updates from the Pilot and configures Citrix ADC proxy using [NITRO](https://developer-docs.citrix.com/projects/citrix-adc-nitro-api-reference/en/latest/) API calls.

Below are features which are supported in this release:

1. Service Discovery
2. Load Balancing
3. Secure Ingress for HTTP based services
4. Secure Ingress for TCP based services
5. Weighted Clusters
6. HTTP Rewrite and redirect
7. HTTP Fault Injection
8. End User Authentication using JWT
9. Transport Authentication using mTLS

The detailed list of fields supported on Citrix ADC as per the Istio CRDs (Destination Rule, Virtual Service, Policy, Gateway, Service Entry) can be found [here](features.md).
